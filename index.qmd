Hi, I'm **Doug**, a data scientist and water resource specialist working on water rights, water supply, and sustainability across Colorado and the Western U.S. I specialize in using **geospatial** and **data analysis** tools to collect, manage, and analyze historic, current, and future water resource data. From this, I enjoy creating impactful reports, stunning visualizations, and functional applications to deliver clear, user-friendly insights.

Iâ€™m passionate about **education and outreach**, working to help communities and stakeholders understand hydrology and water resource challenges through accessible communication and engaging initiatives. I am also obsessed with **Irrigation Ditches** and **Storm Water Infrastructure**. You can often find me following irrigation ditch canals and floodplain flow paths, especially during good rain storms.
