### COVID-19 Spread and Case Estimates: [COVID-19 Cases](https://ddunn303.github.io/csu-523c/lab-01.html)

### Irrigation Ditch Companies

While working on the City of Boulder's water supply team, I held several positions with different Irrigation Ditch Companies that the City had an ownership or interest in. My duties varied, but for several companies I developed websites to provide education and outreach materials, provide shareholders with company information, and host real time data availability data.

### City of Boulder Irrigation Ditch Education and Outreach

As part of my role at the City of Boulder, I led Education and Outreach efforts related to water rights, water supply, and Irrigation Ditch operations. To provide information about these complex topics, I developed a number of documents for City Staff and the public.
